# Encoder Tool for WAF Bypass Techniques
================

A command-line utility that takes a payload as input and encodes it using various encoding schemes.

### Overview

The Encoder Tool is a Python script designed to encode payloads using various encoding schemes and suggest techniques for bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). This tool can be useful for security researchers and penetration testers who need to test the resilience of web applications against different types of attacks.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

     git clone https://github.com/FlyingEagl3/Encoder.git
     cd Encoder
     
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Requirements
                 
    Python 3.x
    Required Python modules:
           argparse
           idna
The script will automatically attempt to install any missing modules.

### Usage

To use the Encoder tool, simply run the command with the payload as an argument:


    python Encoder.py -p "YourPayloadHere" -v

For example:

    python Encoder.py -p "https://example.com" -v    
    
    or

    python Encoder.py -p 'payload' -v


This will encode the payload using all supported encoding schemes and print the encoded payload for each scheme.

The Encoder tool supports the following options:

    
      -p, --payload: The payload to encode (required).
      -v, --verbose: Increase verbosity to see detailed output (recommended).
      --update: Check for updates (optional).


## Features
     Multiple Encoding Schemes: The tool supports a wide range of encoding techniques, including:
     URL Encoding
     HTML Entity Encoding
     Base64 Encoding
     ROT13 Encoding
     XOR Encoding
     And many more!
